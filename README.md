# Kuznets
Kuznets is an interactive economics tutor. The goal is for it to teach a novice the key concepts in Greg Mankiw's Macroeconomics textbook in three hours or less.

The core of Kuznets is a simulation of an economy that a student can play with. Individual households and firms interact in the simulation, along with government, financial markets, and international economies, and the ability to see and modify these interactions provides a faster way to build intuition on economic concepts as compared to traditional textbooks or lectures.

Different concepts can be revealed as the student progresses. In the early stages it is made clear that economic growth is the result of people creating things that other people want. In later stages they can change monetary policy and see the effect on inflation, economic activity, and asset prices. Tax policy changes will affect hiring decisions and working decisions, as well as the distribution of income.

Data generated from the simulation can be used to illustrate various relationships. Okun's law can be seen by plotting unemployment and GDP growth. The effects of interest rate changes can be plotted on an IS-LM curve. Kuznets handles all the data work so that the charts can be drawn at will (or when the student is at an appropriate level), which speeds up the intuition.

I am currently implementing the simulation in Python and will have a well-specified model soon. The next stage will be developing a front-end (likely in React given that the data are visualised in Dash) and then a back end to handle the users and data. Following that will be developing the content and testing the results. Click here to see a wireframe mockup.

Why Kuznets
Australia is seeing a precipitous decline in the study of economics. Enrolment in Yr 12 Economics has fallen by 70 per cent over the past 25 years, with even steeper declines seen in the enrolment of females and of public school students. Declining interest in economics has been observed in other countries, including the United States and United Kingdom (with the steepest declines seen among those not white, relatively wealthy, or male, although there have been declines within that cohort too).

In Australia the Reserve Bank has lobbied the state government to adjust the high school curriculum in favour of economics.

Tyler Cowen

I have created various toy economic models in the past. In high school I created a circular flow of income in Visual Basic. I am increasingly convinced that there is latent demand for this.

Kuznets.co
The platform is named in honour of Simon Kuznets, an economist who, among other things, helped create the concept of Gross National Product, devised measures to compute it, won a Nobel Prize for his work on economic growth and how countries at similar stages of development are nonetheless different, and discovered a relationship between income inequality and economic growth.

About me
I graduated from The University of Western Australia with degrees in Economics (Hons) and Computer Science. While at UWA I tutored Macroeconomics 101 and Monetary Economics 210. I am a Senior Analyst at the Reserve Bank of Australia.
